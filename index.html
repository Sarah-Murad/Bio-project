  <h1 class = "primaryHeading emphasis2"> Well Hey There! </h1>

  <p> I assume you’re here to read all about me? <span class ="emphasis"><strong> Sarah Murad? </strong></span>Then look no further! I love talking about myself, because I’m an incredibly <em> interesting </em> person </p>

  <p> Since I’m so interesting, here is a photo to show how interesting I really am:</p>

  <img class="imageContainer" src="img/Me.jpg" alt="An interesting person">

  <p class = "caption"> pretty <strong> interesting </strong> huh </p>

  <p>Now let’s get into my spectacularly interesting life: </p>

  <p>Before George brown I used to be at Sheridan, and studied (in order of appearance): </p>

  <ul>
    <li> Software Development and Network Engineering (stayed 1 year) </li>
    <li> Bachelors of Interaction Design (stayed 1 semester) </li>
  </ul>

  <span class = "italics">I left the first one because I:</span>
  <ol>
    <li>Don’t like math, never been good at math, never will be.</li>
    <li>Coding boring programs is boring (looking at you, java calculators…)</li>
    <li>Network Engineering is a whole bunch of memorization and back-end, thus… boring</li>
  </ol>


    <span class ="italics">I left the second one because:</span>
    <ol>
      <li>The program went extremely fast because of being quite competitive</li>
      <li>Very harsh grading on all fronts and no accommodations or support</li>
      <li>The program coordinator himself said that if I can’t keep up I should withdraw and do a diploma in the subject instead</li>
    </ol>


  <p> <span class = "bold"> … so I did! </span> Now I couldn’t be happier! Excuse me for being  wholesome, but this program has already given me so much confidence in my abilities, support and encouragement that I wouldn’t trade it for anything! I can’t wait to learn more!
  </p>

    Now as for my interesting hobbies, I’m into:
    <ul> 
      <li> Playing video games (Big Nintendo fan) </li>
      <li> Watching anime! (Shout-out to FullMetal Alchemist Brotherhood) </li>
      <li> Singing (Not to brag but I have a youtube cover channel <a class = "link" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQhOn_MzKHuPPO-LEOGNzUw">here</a>) </a> </li>
      <li> Biking (in the non-corona times…)</li>
    </ul>

  <h3 class = "end emphasis">Well… was that interesting enough for a bio?</h3>
  <h1 class = "end emphasis">~ Fin ~</h1>
